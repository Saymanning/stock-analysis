# Stock-analysis
---
## Overview of Project: The client, Steve requested assistance in an analysis of a green stock he was researching for his parents to possibly invest in. He was pleased with the original analysis provided in Excel. Now, the goal is to use VBA in Excel to further analyze an expanded dataset of stocks to include the entire stock market from the past few years for Steve and his parents to compare. 
--- 
## Purpose: The purpose of this project was to provide Steve with an in-depth analysis of stocks and enable him to quickly and easily access the data and results of the analysis. The code from in the original dataset and analysis needed to be refactored in order to achieve this.
---
### Results:
The code was refactored in order to be able to loop through the data just once to collect all the information without the runtime being too long.
